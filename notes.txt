first issue (a minor one) is to set up the event. have it triggered by the registration and send he appropriate information

1/25

made an acccount database, the 2nd after namedatase. both ahve a testing databse. make sure everything gets sent to tthe right place

the mongodb extension connects the the connection
the databse is what the env connects to


1/29

had put a premade file in app.get() as a test.
What I had gotten was 'mongodb://localhost:27017/Accounts_Database', but NO UPDATE
    
    so I know that there wasnt some sort of inherent error.

the problem is that there are two different directions the code is going

having the focu and app.get method implies that I want the event of the form to cause the code to run
but the fact that I was expecting the cpde to update upon the save, (and show the new document) suggests something else

what I need to do is to either:
    have a way for the code to show up WITHOUT the app.get
    OR
    have a way for the code to show up based on the form

should try the second first

forgot mongoose.connect(process.env.Accounturi)

TypeError: path argument is required to res.sendFile

import.meta.dirname  
    the directory the script is in
    node example.js from /Users/mjr
         /Users/mjr
    not global, local to each module
import.meta.filename 
    the filename fo the code being executed
    node example.js from /Users/mjr
         /Users/mjr/example.js

app.get about wotking with get requests
app.post to the dateabse...or something like that


2/1

partial success. can send the email and passwords to mondob, but for whatever reason, not the username. likely a small syntacical error.

I have successfully. managed to make and send account data to a database.

other things I need to do:

have proper code shown when chaing the url
    (this is likely where the ejs template engine starts to matter )
have confirmation emails sent to an email
have a way to block out the passwords
have good password standards
have a way to sign into an account
have a way to reset your password
have tfa
have warning that you got the username or password wrong
social media feed

start with ejs

2/2

needed to make an update. 

nothings showing up. fix that. likely pathing involved

2/3

everything runs on index.html, but nothign on home.ejs
didnt need res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 				import.meta.url));
should probably integrate MVC early

Model: Manages the information and responds to requests from other info 
View: what the user interacts with. they sened info and get updates
Controller: handles user input and both updates the Model and the View based on model changes. Stuff like input validation and user transformation

exL signing on
    the view gets the login credentials and sends to the controller. 
    the controller figures out if its legit and sends to model
    model will send info of answer(and its data) to the view

but before that: I need to first get the css to work. I have it properly linked (at least I think so), do I need rid of index html first?
    tried. didnt work. at least everything else is still showing up

//res.render('AccountMakingPractice.css') is NOTHING

2/4

app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'views' ))); was needed

for regex, anything...@...".""com"?

Actually....I need to get to the formatting first.
Used ejs to make some reusable assets, like the layout menu. 
I will be light on the layout, will focus on functionality first. Need to make sure there are plenty of proper links.
    make sure all fo the buttons link to the proper urls


should be able to use 



let MenuButton = document.querySelectorAll('[data-button="defaultmenuitem"]');



for (let l = 0; l < MenuButton.length; l++) {
  MenuButton[l].addEventListener("click", (evt) => {
  
      let thehref = MenuArray[l].getAttribute("href");
      contain.push(thehref);
     console.log(seccuss3)
    console.log(MenuArray)
          MenuArray[l].addEventListener("click", (evt) => {
            let thehref = MenuArray[l].getAttribute("href");
            console.log(thehref)
            let hrefslice = thehref.slice(1);
            window.location.href = `${hrefslice}.html`;
            contain = []
        
  
    });

  })}  

  somehow

  NavbarButton


  2/5

  cant use document with the function I had. forgot.
    i think i need to do an app.get for the...either the buttons or the page.
        and the res.render will render the right page

if (typeof window !== 'undefined') { code}
    can cause it to work
    or at least not run an error.

I need to first incorporate it in express code

<a href="...watever"> + app.get(thehref) will allow the links to work 

I managed to get the links to work. so NEXT 
    have confirmation emails sent to an email


2/13

/^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/
soemthing like this for email validation.

there is a console.log for "failure" but it seems like the email validation is working
    forgot the theemail argument

next...I need to find a way to send the email. will need UUID and nodemailer

The terminal process termainated with exit code 
1073741510


//import { app, PORT} from './app.js'
    needed to be gone, because nothing was being imported

3/17

both port and app are not being imported. i can declare them in the file and they will work, but not otherwise

3/20

I need to have the import to start with export

export const professor = "Utonium"
export const girls =["Bubbles", "Blossom", "Buttercup"]

test('Who is the professor', () =>{
 expect(professor).toBe("Utonium")
 })


 3/21

 a few strange things

 trying
 vitest --run --debug
 but it said vitest isnt recognized
    could be error of ai?
need to check.


3/22

moved declarations into utils and it worked

the issue is that importing everything causes the whole file to run, including the server parts
    other thigngs can cause error, there can be functions being run multiple times, etc...

maybe its time to start distribtuting code


3/23

MVC

model how data organized
view what users see
controllers interacts inputs with the modal
