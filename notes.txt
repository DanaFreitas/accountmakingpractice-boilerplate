first issue (a minor one) is to set up the event. have it triggered by the registration and send he appropriate information

1/25

made an acccount database, the 2nd after namedatase. both ahve a testing databse. make sure everything gets sent to tthe right place

the mongodb extension connects the the connection
the databse is what the env connects to


1/29

had put a premade file in app.get() as a test.
What I had gotten was 'mongodb://localhost:27017/Accounts_Database', but NO UPDATE
    
    so I know that there wasnt some sort of inherent error.

the problem is that there are two different directions the code is going

having the focu and app.get method implies that I want the event of the form to cause the code to run
but the fact that I was expecting the cpde to update upon the save, (and show the new document) suggests something else

what I need to do is to either:
    have a way for the code to show up WITHOUT the app.get
    OR
    have a way for the code to show up based on the form

should try the second first

forgot mongoose.connect(process.env.Accounturi)

TypeError: path argument is required to res.sendFile

app.get about wotking with get requests
app.post to the dateabse...or something like that


2/1

partial success. can send the email and passwords to mondob, but for whatever reason, not the username. likely a small syntacical error.

I have successfully. managed to make and send account data to a database.

other things I need to do:

have proper code shown when chaing the url
    (this is likely where the ejs template engine starts to matter )
have confirmation emails sent to an email
have a way to block out the passwords
have good password standards
have a way to sign into an account
have a way to reset your password
have tfa
have warning that you got the username or password wrong
social media feed

start with ejs

2/2

needed to make an update. 

nothings showing up. fix that. likely pathing involved

2/3

everything runs on index.html, but nothign on home.ejs
didnt need res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 				import.meta.url));
should probably integrate MVC early

Model: Manages the information and responds to requests from other info 
View: what the user interacts with. they sened info and get updates
Controller: handles user input and both updates the Model and the View based on model changes. Stuff like input validation and user transformation

exL signing on
    the view gets the login credentials and sends to the controller. 
    the controller figures out if its legit and sends to model
    model will send info of answer(and its data) to the view

but before that: I need to first get the css to work. I have it properly linked (at least I think so), do I need rid of index html first?
    tried. didnt work. at least everything else is still showing up

//res.render('AccountMakingPractice.css') is NOTHING

2/4

app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'views' ))); was needed

for regex, anything...@...".""com"?

Actually....I need to get to the formatting first.
Used ejs to make some reusable assets, like the layout menu. 
I will be light on the layout, will focus on functionality first. Need to make sure there are plenty of proper links.
    make sure all fo the buttons link to the proper urls


should be able to use 



let MenuButton = document.querySelectorAll('[data-button="defaultmenuitem"]');



for (let l = 0; l < MenuButton.length; l++) {
  MenuButton[l].addEventListener("click", (evt) => {
  
      let thehref = MenuArray[l].getAttribute("href");
      contain.push(thehref);
     console.log(seccuss3)
    console.log(MenuArray)
          MenuArray[l].addEventListener("click", (evt) => {
            let thehref = MenuArray[l].getAttribute("href");
            console.log(thehref)
            let hrefslice = thehref.slice(1);
            window.location.href = `${hrefslice}.html`;
            contain = []
        
  
    });

  })}  

  somehow

  NavbarButton


  2/5

  cant use document with the function I had. forgot.
    i think i need to do an app.get for the...either the buttons or the page.
        and the res.render will render the right page

if (typeof window !== 'undefined') { code}
    can cause it to work
    or at least not run an error.

I need to first incorporate it in express code

<a href="...watever"> + app.get(thehref) will allow the links to work 

I managed to get the links to work. so NEXT 
    have confirmation emails sent to an email


2/13

/^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/
soemthing like this for email validation.

there is a console.log for "failure" but it seems like the email validation is working
    forgot the theemail argument

next...I need to find a way to send the email. will need UUID and nodemailer

The terminal process termainated with exit code 
1073741510


//import { app, PORT} from './app.js'
    needed to be gone, because nothing was being imported

3/17

both port and app are not being imported. i can declare them in the file and they will work, but not otherwise

3/20

I need to have the import to start with export

export const professor = "Utonium"
export const girls =["Bubbles", "Blossom", "Buttercup"]

test('Who is the professor', () =>{
 expect(professor).toBe("Utonium")
 })


 3/21

 a few strange things

 trying
 vitest --run --debug
 but it said vitest isnt recognized
    could be error of ai?
need to check.


3/22

moved declarations into utils and it worked

the issue is that importing everything causes the whole file to run, including the server parts
    other thigngs can cause error, there can be functions being run multiple times, etc...

maybe its time to start distribtuting code


3/23

MVC

model how data organized
view what users see
controllers interacts inputs with the modal


exported the userparts

registering should be something
and validating email
figure out where all f of the app.whatever go


3/24

need to do move the register post. might have to move around the declarations.


3/25

still organizing the code.
go to newuser.find a way to import userschema

named exports vs default exports

named exports can be many in one module
    export function add(a, b) {
          return a + b;
        }
    export function subtract(a, b) {
        return a - b;
        }

    import { add, subtract } from './math.js';


default exports allow only module

    export default function add(a, b) 
            {return a + b;}
    import addFunction from './math.js';
            can assign any name to it


figure out the newuser module

app.post("/register", newUser );
ReferenceError: newUser is not defined
    This is the error. I need to have the module declared
        it starts with the register button triggering it        
        this will allow the newuser to run (and it having the import for the schema)
        I need to export....the specific function that will run. it will update the database along with the post changin g the url


3/29

MongooseError: The `uri` parameter to `openUri()` must be a string, got "undefined". 
Make sure the first parameter to `mongoose.connect()` or `mongoose.createConnection()` is a string.


idea:i could write unit test for the mongoose connection


I think I have been mixing up user and new user. should clear up the wording

.env needs to be in the root folder




testing the website on the console. its stalling on the actual account creation visually
remember where its being updated!


3/31

changed port number to allign with the one for mongodb

I need to add the rendering of the new page

changed the host to 28017 from 27017       
    could get to the home page but not much else    

keep the earlier 3000/21017

when filing out the forms, the acual registeration is at /RegisterAccount
    
I need to modify app.post("/register", newAccount);


If app.get("/RegisterAccount", (req, res) => {
    res.render("RegisterAccount.ejs")
  });
    comes from the button 
href="/RegisterAccount" is what the navbar gives


I need to modify app.post("/register", newAccount);
action="/register" is what the form gives 

add an href to the button in the form. if this doesnt work, 
change the name or formatting fo the form. there needs to be some way to combine the two.



ireally should learn mocking this stuff

get and post a bit mixed up. ned to have get for the register action. post fo rthe registerac account   
    rename register to registeraction? 

4/1

maybe the book will have an idea. i have checked code. each get or post has a different name and function

look for the .ejs formatting

the navbar 

for them 
example
different sets for if logged in. can do if statements for ejs formats.

<a class="nav-link" href="/auth/register">New User</a>
    this is a button that changes the url 
app.get('/auth/register', redirectIfAuthenticatedMiddleware, newUserController);
    when the url changes to auth/register, the two functions will run as well
        const redirectIfAuthenticatedMiddleware = require('./middleware/redirectIfAuthenticatedMiddleware');    
                checking if everything is fine
        const newUserController = require('./controllers/newUser');
new user    


the issue is module.exports = (req, res) =>{ 
    var username = "" 
    var password = ""
    const data = req.flash('data')[0];    

    if(typeof data != "undefined"){        
        username = data.username
        password = data.password
    }
     
    res.render('register',{        
        errors: req.flash('validationErrors'),
        username: username,
        password: password
    })
}

idk what where this goes next. 
nvm goes to register.ejs


all of that was to set up fo rthe registeration page, not the registration tiself!

looks like after the registration, the next part is a post. in the post is where the redirect is back to home, which has an if statement. 

so the module has the redirect, not the app.js

the storeuser would create and export the user, then redirect to home


4/2/2025

I made a way to make accounts and log back in. what I need to do next is modify the document based on whether or not the account is logged in.
 will do some styling
then, I will figure out how to do signing in and out, and deleting accounts
and password protection

4/3/2025


should loggedin be different from / or should they be if statements
maybe I should have a greeting X to make sure soemthign works

to login, I need to retrieve from the database.
could make a test for that 

I need to use .find for the user. jsut need to figure out how to connect them all together. 

use mongoose documents


I need to figure out a list of everything I need to do, to get it out of my head.

I need to find a way to be "logged on"
maybe an object that starts off empty.
I can have the login/registration credientials be exported to the page the object is on
during the log on, the object needs to be filled with the account info
that in turn can be exported to the front page.


I can probably make a test using the loginstatus. just need to set that up first

I THINK I set it up. so now I just need to set up the test and try that out. also figure out mocking


4/8

I need to mock the following
  does the account creation work?
    mock a creation of an account. 
    how do I make sure that the creation is sent to the database?
  does the account search work?
    I will need to figure out how to do this part in the program proper next


issue. spyon might not be as good as using .mock
other issue: have i been using mocks or stubs?

4/9

what I can do is run vi.mock of the account creation 
    how do I mock the event running?

    learned about factory functinos and hoisting

I have an error 

OverwriteModelError: Cannot overwrite `Account` model once compiled.
 ❯ new model node_modules/mongoose/lib/mongoose.js:606:13
 ❯ models/User.js:16:24
     14| });
     15|
     16| export const Account = new mongoose.model("Account", userSchema);


4/10

the issue is the modal is being compiled multiple times when I run the test.



4/11

export const Account = new mongoose.model("Account", userSchema);
this is being exported from User.js
    how is that being applied to the test? 
    I susepect its import {Schema, Account} from './models/User.js'

that gives me TypeError: The first argument must be of type string or an instance of Buffer, ArrayBuffer, or Array or an Array-like Object.
 Received an instance of Object

 idea. the new account is being imported by import {Schema, Account}, so having the import of 
 new account (which imports Account) means its being run twice! 



 The question though: is why I get the error nothing is being run when the import is gone? 

looking ove rthe code more, i am doing both an import of new account and declaring a variable based on new account.
maybe i should declare a variable based on account instead
    or something else

having both new accounts means that the user model is being imported twice

4/12

i edited out import newAccount from '../controllers/newAccount.js'
and 
import {Schema, Account} from './models/User.js'

that just gives the error

ReferenceError: newAccount is not defined

I NEED the newaccount module to be defined. I suspect I will need to rework the tests instead of the variable declaration

I added back new account and got the error 
TypeError: The first argument must be of type string or an instance of Buffer, ArrayBuffer, or Array or an Array-like Object. 
Received an instance of Object

This is likely because nothing is being returned for thew tests

un comment out  and i get 

OverwriteModelError: Cannot overwrite `Account` model once compiled.

4/12 

I made a change. instead of mocking the newaccount, i am mocking the account to tryo to stop a duplicate of the newaccount module from occuring.

the error I got was 


TypeError: First argument to `Model` constructor must be an object, **not** a string.

     40| test("The account creation works", () => {

I need to have objects instead of strings.

having name, email, password isnt working directly

I have a few options
I can figure out what should be in Account()
I can import the name,email,password, from....somewhere

do I need to have a fake account created?
